Genomic Data Research: Identifying Potential Therapeutic Targets for Cancer

Background and Rationale

Based on genomic data, research study seeks to identify early high-risk targets for a number of cancer types. The research considers a holistic study of genomic data analysis methods like RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and ChIP-Seq and how it has improved our understanding of the underlying molecular causes of cancer and allowed for the creation of individualised therapy regimens.

Aims and Objectives

The primary objectives of this research project are to:

Study genomic data analysis techniques, including RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and ChIP-Seq, to identify potential therapeutic targets for specific types of cancer.

Investigate the functional relevance of the identified targets in given cancers.

Research Design and Methods

The research project will employ the following steps:

1) Acquire relevant Genomic data from accurate repositories.

2) Quality control of the Genomic data to assess the global quality of the dataset.

3) Systematic analysis of genomic and systems properties, study identifiers that notify us of high risk of potential cancers and review treatment plans which can be used to remedy them.

Ethical Considerations :

This research project will adhere to standard genomic data operations considerations, including:
Ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the genomic data used in the study.
Obtaining informed consent from participants, if applicable.
Complying with relevant guidelines and regulations for the use of human genomic data in research.

Outcomes :
Generate a holistic report containing dashboards and visuals to represent the finding obtained from the study.
