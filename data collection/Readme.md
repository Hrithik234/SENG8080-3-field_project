Task: To provide data from s3 using boto3 
The data is already available as a TSV file.
#needhelp
Need more clear information on how to set up and integrate to use S3 for connecting it with data and fetching it from there.
It would be really helpful if anyone can guide us through

### Details about the data
# Cancer Therapy and Clonal Hematopoiesis (MSK, Nat Genet 2020)

### Data for all types of cancer detection

MSK-IMPACT was used to identify clonal hematopoiesis mutations in blood samples from 24,146 individuals whose tumor-blood pairings were analysed.PubMed

The following cancer types can be identified from the data:
1. Breast Cancer
2. Nerve Sheath Tumor
3. Retinoblastoma
4. Sex Cord Stromal Tumor
5. Miscellaneous Brain Tumor
6. Wilms Tumor 
7. Miscellaneous Neuroepithelial Tumor
